ABSTRACT
Crop yield estimation is a major issue of crop monitoring which remains particularlychallenging in developing countries due to the problem of timely and adequate data availability.Whereas traditional agricultural systems mainly rely on scarce ground-survey data, freelyavailablemulti-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing images are excellent tools to support thesevulnerable systems by accurately monitoring and estimating crop yields beforeharvest.Moreover,The complementary nature of different modalities and multiple bandsusedinremote sensing data is helpful for tasks such as change detection and the prediction of agriculturalvariables. Nonetheless, correctly processing a multi-modal dataset is not a simple task, owingtothe presence of different data resolutions and formats. In the past few years, graph-basedmethodshave proven to be a useful tool in capturing inherent data similarity, in spite of different dataformats, and preserving relevant topological and geometric information. In this paper, weproposea graph-based data fusion algorithm for remotely sensed images applied to (i) data-drivensemi-unsupervised change detection and (ii) growth estimation in rice crops. In order todetect thechange, we evaluated the performance of four competing algorithms on fourteendatasets. Toestimate growth in rice crops, we compared our proposal in terms of root mean squarederror(RMSE) concerning a recent approach based on vegetation indices as features. The resultsconfirmthat the proposed graph-based data fusion algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methodsforchange detection and growth estimation in rice crops. Keywords:
